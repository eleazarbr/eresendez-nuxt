## Workflowy

I share in Workflowy the ideas of things that I want to build, the projects that I am working on or have finished as well.

- Ideas - Ideas I want to bring into existence
- Learn - Things that I am learning or want to learn
- Learning - Courses that I am taking or want to take

## Notes
- [Find a problem. Tell a story. Sell a service. Deliver a result. Build a product.][9]
- [If your idea already exists it's validation that there's a market for it. If your execution of the same idea is 1) better, or 2) cheaper, you can reach customers in that market.][10]
